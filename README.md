# CPP_RayTracer

This repository contains my RayTracer built from scratch in C++.

FEATURS :
- Simple Shapes like Spheres, Moving Spheres, Axis-Aligned Rectangles, Boxes, Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes.
- Constant Density Volumes
- Easy to use world generator
- Per Pixel Multisampling using Monte Carlo methods
- Bounding Volume Hierarchy Node
- PNG Image Renders
- Fully RayTraced Scenes
- Inheritable Material Class for custom materials
- Image based Textures
- Perlin Noise and Textures
- Emmisive Material
- Asynchronous Multi-threaded Render Loop
- Customizable Camera Settings like FOV, Position + Orientation, Depth of Field, Motion Blur, Aperture, Aspect Ratio

SCENES :
- Random scenes with Moving Spheres, Spheres of different material like glass, metal, diffuse, and Checkered Textures
- Earth Textured Sphere
- Cornell Box
- Simple Light Test Scene
- Two Spheres with Perlin Noise Textures
- Final Scene from "Raytracing: The Next Week"

FEATURE ROADMAP :
- Parallelizing the main render loop and exporting it to GPU with CUDA
- More Shapes
- Denoiser
- GUI to change Object Locations and Camera Settings
